Great start 👍 You’ve covered the **core browsing flow** already. After the index (home), product listing, and single product details pages, a typical e-commerce app usually adds pages in this order of importance:

---

## 1. Cart & Checkout Flow (Highest Priority)

These turn browsing into purchases.

1. **Cart Page**

   * View selected products
   * Update quantity / remove items
   * Show subtotal, taxes, shipping estimate

2. **Checkout Page**
   Often split into steps:

   * Shipping address
   * Delivery method
   * Payment details
   * Order review

3. **Order Confirmation / Success Page**

   * Order number
   * Summary of purchased items
   * Estimated delivery date

---

## 2. Authentication & User Account

Needed for real-world usage.

4. **Login Page**

5. **Sign Up / Register Page**

6. **Forgot Password / Reset Password**

7. **User Profile / Account Dashboard**

   * Personal info
   * Saved addresses
   * Saved payment methods

8. **Order History Page**

   * List of past orders
   * Link to order details

9. **Order Details Page**

   * Status (processing, shipped, delivered)
   * Tracking info

---

## 3. Search & Discovery Enhancements

Improve usability.

10. **Search Results Page**
11. **Category Pages**

* Electronics, Clothing, etc.

12. **Filter / Sort Results**

* Price, rating, brand, availability

13. **Wishlist / Favorites Page**

## 4. Support & Trust Pages

Important for credibility.

14. **About Us**
15. **Contact Us**
16. **FAQ / Help Center**
17. **Returns & Refund Policy**

19. **Terms & Conditions**

## 5. Admin / Seller Side (If applicable)

If you plan a full system.

20. **Admin Dashboard**
21. **Product Management (CRUD)**
22. **Order Management**
23. **User Management**
24. **Inventory Management**

## 6. Error & Utility Pages (Often Forgotten)

Very important for polish.

25. **404 – Page Not Found**
26. **500 – Server Error**
27. **Loading / Empty State Pages**
28. **Maintenance Page**

## Suggested Minimum Roadmap (MVP)

If you want a **clean MVP**, focus on:

1. Home
2. Product Listing
3. Product Details
4. Cart
5. Checkout
6. Order Confirmation
7. Login / Register
8. User Orders

If you want, tell me:

* **Frontend only or full-stack?**
* **Tech stack (React, Next.js, Vue, etc.)**
* **B2C or multi-vendor?**

I can then give you a **page hierarchy diagram** or **folder structure** tailored to your setup 🚀
